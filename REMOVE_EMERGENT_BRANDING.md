## 📝 If You Need to Remove Branding Yourself (Local Development)

If you clone the repo and see any Emergent branding, here's what to check:

### File: `/frontend/public/index.html`

**1. Check for Emergent Badge:**
Look for this code and remove it:
```html
<a id="emergent-badge" ...>
    Made with Emergent
</a>
```

**2. Update Page Title:**
```html
<!-- Change this: -->
<title>Emergent | Fullstack App</title>

<!-- To this: -->
<title>Arnav Kumar | Data Analyst & ML Engineer</title>
```

**3. Update Meta Description:**
```html
<!-- Change this: -->
<meta name="description" content="A product of emergent.sh" />

<!-- To this: -->
<meta name="description" content="Portfolio of Arnav Kumar - Data Analyst & ML Engineer" />
```

**4. Remove Tracking Scripts:**
```html
<!-- Remove these scripts: -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/rrweb@latest/dist/rrweb.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://d2adkz2s9zrlge.cloudfront.net/rrweb-recorder-20250919-1.js"></script>

<!-- And the PostHog analytics script at the bottom -->
```

## 🔍 How to Verify Removal
